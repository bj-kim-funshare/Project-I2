name: dev-merge
description: Code-reviewed merge of one branch into another via GitHub PR. Main session prepares context (git log, prior PR comments, code-comment cross-checks) inline; dispatches two read-only reviewer sub-agents in parallel (claude-md-compliance-reviewer + bug-detector). Findings with confidence ≥ 80 are posted as PR review comments. A write-capable code-fixer sub-agent applies fixes between rounds. Up to 3 iteration rounds before halting for master. Merge method = merge commit (--no-ff equivalent). Works on any git+gh repository — external projects or this harness itself.

# dev-merge

Merge `<from-branch>` into `<to-branch>` on the current repository's GitHub remote, with auto-iterated code review.

Replaces the prior `merge-i` (work → `i-dev`) and `merge-main` (`i-dev` → `main`) skills — same skill, master specifies the branch pair.

## Invocation

```
/dev-merge <from-branch> <to-branch>
```

Both branch names required. Works against the current working directory's GitHub remote — whether that is an external project repository (e.g., a member of a registered project group) or this harness itself (Project-I2). The skill does not need to distinguish at code level; `gh` operates on `cwd`.

## Pre-conditions

1. `cwd` is inside a git repository with a configured GitHub remote.
2. `gh` CLI installed and authenticated for that remote.
3. Both `<from-branch>` and `<to-branch>` exist locally and remotely (master pushes the from-branch before invoking).
4. No existing open PR for the same `<from-branch>` → `<to-branch>` pair (would collide).
5. Current local branch may be anything — the skill operates via PR, not via local merge.

## WIP rule note

`README.md` §G's universal `{skill}-{이슈번호}` WIP rule does not apply to `dev-merge` literally. The from-branch supplied by master IS the work branch (its own WIP, created by an earlier skill or by master directly). The PR replaces the issue concept. Hotfix commits go onto the from-branch, not onto a nested WIP — nesting WIPs adds no isolation here and complicates the gh workflow.

## Worktree 격리 (from-branch 작업)

`code-fixer` 의 fix-apply 와 conflict-PENDING 의 rebase 둘 다 메인 working tree 에서 직접 수행하면 다른 세션의 HEAD 를 mutate 할 위험이 있다. 본 스킬은 호출 직후 from-branch 위에 worktree 를 만들어 모든 fix / conflict-resolve 작업을 그 worktree 안에서만 수행한다. 절차: `.claude/md/worktree-lifecycle.md`.

```bash
# Entry ritual
git worktree prune

wt_from="../$(basename "$(pwd)")-worktrees/devmerge-<from-branch>"
git worktree add "${wt_from}" <from-branch>   # checkout existing branch, no -b
```

- `code-fixer` 디스패치마다 `worktree_cwd = <wt_from 절대경로>` 전달.
- conflict-PENDING 의 rebase / 충돌-해결 명령은 `git -C <wt_from> ...` 으로 수행.
- 메인 세션의 `git` / `gh` 명령은 메인 cwd 의 working tree 에서 그대로 (PR 조회, mergeable check, `gh pr merge` 등 — repo 단위 명령이라 worktree 와 무관).
- 종료 시점 (성공 머지 또는 master halt) 에 `git worktree remove ${wt_from}`. PR mergeable check 실패로 conflict-PENDING 만 발생한 경우에도 종료할 때 동일하게 worktree 제거.

## Context preparation (main session, no sub-agent)

Before dispatching reviewers, main session confirms the PR exists and collects only identifiers:

| Info | Source |
|---|---|
| PR number | `gh pr list --head <from-branch> --json number` |
| Group leader (if any) | cwd matched against `targets[].cwd` in `.claude/project-group/*/dev.md` — leader name only |

PR diff, git log, prior PR review comments, CLAUDE.md text, and group-policy file contents are NOT pre-fetched and NOT inlined in reviewer dispatch prompts. Reviewers fetch what they need directly. Per `.claude/md/sub-agent-prompt-budget.md` (recommended 5–15k tokens, hard cap 100k): PR diffs, prior-round findings JSON, and git logs are not inlined in dispatch prompts. Reviewers call `gh pr diff <PR#>` and `gh pr view <PR#> --json reviews,comments` themselves; code-fixer reads PR review comments via `gh pr view <PR#> --json reviews,comments` or `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR#>/comments` — so code-fixer's input is the PR number alone.

Group resolution: if cwd matches any `targets[].cwd` entry inside `.claude/project-group/*/dev.md`, the matching `<leader>` name is captured (for passing to reviewers as an identifier). If no match, group-policy is omitted.

## Reviewer dispatch (parallel)

Two read-only sub-agents, dispatched in a single message via the Task tool so they run in parallel:

- **`claude-md-compliance-reviewer`** — diff vs CLAUDE.md and group-policy conventions.
- **`bug-detector`** — logic bugs, null/undefined, off-by-one, race conditions, error handling, type holes.

Each reviewer receives only: `PR number`, `from-branch`, `to-branch`, `worktree_cwd`, and (if resolved) `leader name`. Reviewers fetch the PR diff and prior review comments from GitHub directly. They form judgments independently — neither sees the other's findings — which is the actual reason for parallel dispatch.

## Finding contract

Both reviewers return a JSON array (and only a JSON array) of objects:

```json
{
  "file": "<path relative to repo root>",
  "line_start": <int>,
  "line_end": <int>,
  "confidence": <0-100>,
  "category": "compliance" | "bug" | "logic",
  "message": "<concise Korean issue description>",
  "suggested_fix": "<one-line concrete fix in Korean>"
}
```

Empty array `[]` is the correct output when the agent finds no high-confidence issues.

Confidence is the agent's own self-estimate. Threshold = 80. Findings below threshold must be discarded by the agent before returning — they are not surfaced to the dispatcher, not posted to the PR, not seen by the fixer. This is the "signal over noise" principle: sub-threshold findings turn the review into churn.

## Posting findings to PR

Main session merges both arrays, drops duplicates (same file + overlapping line range + same category), then posts each finding as a PR review comment with GitHub-style anchoring:

```bash
gh pr review <PR-num> --comment --body-file <file>
```

Each comment includes the SHA hash + line range so the user (and the next iteration's `prior-pr-comment-reviewer` context fetch) can navigate precisely.

## Fix iteration loop

If the combined findings array is non-empty:

1. Dispatch `code-fixer` (write-capable Sonnet sub-agent) via Task, with `PR number`, `from-branch`, and `worktree_cwd`. Code-fixer reads its own fix context from PR review comments via `gh pr view <PR#> --json reviews,comments`.
2. `code-fixer` runs all `git` operations as `git -C <worktree_cwd>` (no local `git checkout`), applies fixes, commits with message `dev-merge: 핫픽스 (PR #<num>, iteration <n>)`, pushes to remote.
3. Main session re-dispatches the 2 reviewers (passing the same PR number and branch identifiers — reviewers fetch the updated diff themselves).
4. Loop until both reviewers return `[]`, OR iteration cap is hit.

**Iteration cap = 3.** Rationale: caps the auto-fix loop short enough that master sees a non-converging problem quickly. Three rounds is empirically the point where mechanical fixes have either resolved or revealed they can't. More rounds = chasing a bug the fixer cannot grasp.

On cap exhaustion: halt with a full Korean report of remaining findings. PR is left open. Master decides next step (manual fix, abandon PR, …).

## Lint gate (after auto review iter clean, before PENDING gate)

When both reviewers return `[]` (within the iter cap), run the lint gate before PENDING.

### Determine targets affected by the PR

From the PR diff, identify which `dev.md` `targets[]` are affected:
- For each changed file, find the `target` whose `cwd` contains the file (longest-prefix match).
- Collect the set of affected targets.
- For targets without `lint_command` (or empty), skip — master signaled no lint check desired.

### Dispatch `gate-runner` per affected target

For each affected target with `lint_command`, dispatch `gate-runner` (Haiku 4.5) via Task tool:

```
gate-runner input:
  gate_type: "lint"
  command: <target.lint_command>
  cwd: <target.cwd>
  timeout_ms: 120000
```

Run sequentially (rare to have many — usually 1–2 targets per PR; parallel adds complexity without much speedup).

### Decision

- All lint runs return `exit_code: 0` → lint gate PASS → proceed to PENDING gate.
- Any lint run returns non-zero exit → lint gate FAIL → enter **lint hotfix iter loop**.

### Lint hotfix iter loop (up to 3 iter, independent from review iter)

On lint fail:

1. Synthesize a finding for each failing lint run:
   - `confidence: 100`
   - `category: "lint"`
   - `message: "lint 실패 (target=<name>): <gate-runner summary>"`
   - `suggested_fix: "<target.lint_command> 통과를 위해 수정. failure excerpt: <첫 N 줄>"`
2. Dispatch `code-fixer` with the synthesized findings. Dispatch input includes `worktree_cwd = <wt_from>`. Code-fixer applies fixes, commits, pushes.
3. Re-dispatch `gate-runner` for the same targets. Recompute lint pass/fail.
4. If still failing → iter counter += 1, repeat from step 1 (up to 3 total iters).
5. Iter cap reached with lint still failing → halt. Dispatch `completion-reporter` with:
   - `skill_type: "dev-merge"`
   - `moment: "skill_finalize.blocked"`
   - `data`: assemble per `.claude/md/completion-reporter-contract.md` §6 `dev-merge` `skill_finalize.blocked` schema. Required: `pr_number`, `pr_url`, `from_branch`, `to_branch`, `block_reason`, `block_type` (value `"lint_cap_exhausted"`); optional `leader`, `lint_failure_targets[]`.

   Relay the agent's response verbatim to master.

Lint hotfix iter is INDEPENDENT from the review iter — review iter (3) and lint iter (3) are separate budgets. Total max iter per PR = 6 (3 review + 3 lint), reasonable upper bound.

## PENDING gate (after lint clean, before merge — per `.claude/md/completion-gate-procedure.md`)

When both reviewers return `[]` AND lint gate passes (within respective iter caps), the automated review + lint is clean. **Do NOT auto-merge yet.** Master gets a final intervention chance before the merge commit is created.

Dispatch `completion-reporter` with:
- `skill_type: "dev-merge"`
- `moment`: `"work_complete"` on first arrival (initial clean); `"hotfix_complete"` when re-entering after a master-supervised hotfix iteration.
- `data`: assemble per `.claude/md/completion-reporter-contract.md` §6 `dev-merge` schema.
  - For `work_complete`: required fields `pr_number`, `pr_url`, `from_branch`, `to_branch`, `master_intent_summary`, `result_summary`, `review_rounds`, `findings_count`, `hotfix_commits_count`; optional `leader`, `findings_breakdown`, `conflict_status`, `post_action_hints[]`.
  - For `hotfix_complete`: all `work_complete` required fields plus `current_hotfix_number`, `prior_hotfix_summaries[]` (each `{hotfix_number, summary_ko}`); optional `next_hotfix_number`.

Relay the agent's response verbatim to master, then append the gate prompt:

```
마스터 입력 대기:
  - `머지 완료` (또는 `플랜 완료`) → `gh pr merge` 실행 → 종료
  - `핫픽스 <description>` → master 힌트로 code-fixer 재dispatch (4번째 iter+, master-supervised)
                              → 리뷰어 재dispatch → PENDING 재진입
  - `중단` → 머지 안 함, PR open 유지, halt
  - (다른 입력) → 본 PR 미머지 상태 유지, 마스터 자유 진입
```

Then halt.

### HOTFIX re-entry path (`핫픽스 <description>`)

Master's `<description>` is a hint — typically "L42 의 null 처리 추가" / "환경변수 검증 없음" / etc. Main session:

1. Synthesize a **single high-confidence finding** from master's hint with `confidence: 100`, `category: "compliance"` (or `"bug"` based on hint language), file/line extracted from the hint or marked as `null` if hint doesn't specify.
2. Post the synthetic finding as a PR review comment so the audit trail shows the master-initiated fix.
3. Dispatch `code-fixer` with the synthetic finding as input. Dispatch input includes `worktree_cwd = <wt_from>`. The dispatcher labels this iteration as `master-supervised` rather than the auto-iter counter.
4. After code-fixer commits + pushes, re-dispatch the 2 reviewers on the updated diff (same as automated loop).
5. When reviewers return `[]` again → return to **PENDING gate**. Master may issue more `핫픽스` or finalize.

Master-supervised iterations have no internal cap (unlike the automated 3-iter cap). Master controls the loop via PENDING.

### Cap-exhausted case (iter ≥ 3 with findings remaining)

When the automated iter loop hits the 3-cap with findings still present, the skill halts with the existing cap-exhausted report (no PENDING). Master decides next steps manually (review the open PR, resolve outside the skill, or re-invoke `/dev-merge` after master-side fixes).

The PENDING gate is only entered after a CLEAN automated loop result.

### Other input handling

If master's next message is not a recognized trigger:
- Skill returns control. PR stays open, unmerged.
- Master may finalize later by re-invoking `/dev-merge <from> <to>` — the skill detects the existing open PR and re-enters at the PENDING gate (skipping new PR creation + auto-iter).

## Merge (on `머지 완료` / `플랜 완료`)

### Pre-merge mergeable check

Before running `gh pr merge`, check the PR's mergeable state:

```bash
state=$(gh pr view <PR-num> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus --jq '.mergeable + " " + .mergeStateStatus')
```

- `MERGEABLE CLEAN` → proceed to merge command.
- `CONFLICTING <any>` → enter **Conflict-PENDING** (next section).
- `UNKNOWN <any>` → wait 2 seconds, retry the check once. Still UNKNOWN → enter Conflict-PENDING (treat as conflict for safety).
- Anything else (`BLOCKED` etc. — branch protection, required checks not passed) → halt with the verbatim state in the error report. PR stays open.

### Merge command

When mergeable check passes (`MERGEABLE CLEAN`):

```bash
gh pr merge <PR-num> --merge --delete-branch=false
```

`--merge` selects merge-commit method, producing a non-fast-forward merge commit per master's lock — preserves the PR's scope visibly in history. `--delete-branch=false` keeps the from-branch in place; master decides cleanup separately.

If `gh pr merge` itself fails despite the mergeable check passing (rare — concurrent push intercepted the merge), retry the mergeable check once. Re-check → CONFLICTING means a concurrent push happened, enter Conflict-PENDING. Re-check → other failure means transient issue, halt with verbatim error.

After `gh pr merge` returns success: `git worktree remove ${wt_from}`. On failure or master halt, the worktree is preserved for forensics; master decides cleanup.

## Conflict-PENDING (PR 머지 충돌 처리)

`gh pr merge` 충돌은 보통 의미적 (semantic) — 양쪽이 같은 코드 영역에 서로 다른 변경. 자동 "양측 보존" 시도는 잘못된 결합 위험이 크므로 master 결정을 default 로 한다 (CLAUDE.md §5 일반 규칙의 dev-merge 특화 carve-out).

### Conflict-PENDING 메시지

Dispatch `completion-reporter` with:
- `skill_type: "dev-merge"`
- `moment: "work_complete"`
- `data`: assemble per `.claude/md/completion-reporter-contract.md` §6 `dev-merge` `work_complete` schema. Required: `pr_number`, `pr_url`, `from_branch`, `to_branch`, `master_intent_summary`, `result_summary`, `review_rounds`, `findings_count`, `hotfix_commits_count`; optional `leader`, `conflict_status` (set to the `mergeable,mergeStateStatus` output verbatim).

Relay the agent's response verbatim to master, then append the gate prompt:

```
마스터 입력 대기:
  - `핫픽스 <resolution hint>` → code-fixer 가 hint + 충돌 마커 + 양측 diff 받아 해결
                                  → push → mergeable 재확인 → PENDING/Conflict-PENDING 분기
  - `수동 머지 완료` → master 가 오프라인 해결 완료 알림
                       skill 이 gh pr view 로 상태 재확인
                         → state=MERGED → 정상 완료 보고 + 종료
                         → state=OPEN, mergeable=MERGEABLE → 자동 gh pr merge 시도 → 종료
                         → state=OPEN, mergeable=CONFLICTING → Conflict-PENDING 재진입
  - `중단` → halt, PR open 유지, 자동 해결 시도 안 함
  - (다른 입력) → 본 PR 미머지 유지, 마스터 자유 진입
```

### Conflict 핫픽스 path (`핫픽스 <resolution hint>` in Conflict-PENDING)

Differs from the normal HOTFIX path — the input task is conflict resolution, not new feature fix.

1. Pull the latest to-branch:
   ```bash
   git -C ${wt_from} fetch origin <to-branch>
   # from-branch 는 worktree 가 이미 checkout 한 상태 — 다시 checkout 하지 않는다
   git -C ${wt_from} pull --rebase=false origin <to-branch>
   ```
   This produces conflict markers inside ${wt_from}. All conflict-resolve commands run with `git -C ${wt_from}`.
2. Synthesize a finding for code-fixer:
   - `confidence: 100`
   - `category: "conflict"`
   - `message`: `"PR #<num> merge conflict — master hint: <resolution hint>"`
   - `suggested_fix`: master's hint verbatim
   - Affected files: list parsed from `git status --porcelain` showing `UU` / `AA` / `DU` etc. conflict states.
3. Dispatch `code-fixer` with the synthetic finding. Code-fixer must:
   - Read each conflict file, identify `<<<<<<< / ======= / >>>>>>>` markers.
   - Apply master's hint to resolve each marker (keep one side / merge per hint).
   - `git add` resolved files.
   - `git commit -m "dev-merge: conflict resolution per master hint (PR #<num>)"`.
   - `git push origin <from-branch>`.
4. After code-fixer's resolution commit pushes, re-check mergeable via `gh pr view`:
   - `MERGEABLE CLEAN` → return to normal PENDING gate (master can issue `머지 완료` to merge, or another `핫픽스`).
   - Still `CONFLICTING` → re-enter Conflict-PENDING (resolution incomplete; master provides more hint or switches to `수동 머지 완료`).

### `수동 머지 완료` verification

```bash
state=$(gh pr view <PR-num> --json state,mergeable --jq '.state + " " + .mergeable')
```

- `MERGED <any>` → success report (using merge SHA from `gh pr view --json mergeCommit`), end of skill.
- `OPEN MERGEABLE` → master resolved offline but didn't merge. Skill runs `gh pr merge` automatically, then success report.
- `OPEN CONFLICTING` → master claim doesn't match state. Re-enter Conflict-PENDING with note that master's resolution did not land.
- `CLOSED <any>` (not merged) → halt with error: PR was closed without merging. Master decides next.

## Reporting

After successful merge, dispatch `completion-reporter` with:
- `skill_type: "dev-merge"`
- `moment: "skill_finalize"`
- `data`: assemble per `.claude/md/completion-reporter-contract.md` §6 `dev-merge` `skill_finalize` schema. Required: `pr_number`, `pr_url`, `from_branch`, `to_branch`, `result_summary`, `merge_sha`, `review_rounds`, `findings_count`, `hotfix_commits_count`, `worktree_cleanup_status`; optional `leader`, `findings_breakdown`, `conflict_resolution_commits`.

Relay the agent's response verbatim to master.

On review cap-exhausted halt, dispatch `completion-reporter` with:
- `skill_type: "dev-merge"`
- `moment: "skill_finalize.blocked"`
- `data`: assemble per `.claude/md/completion-reporter-contract.md` §6 `dev-merge` `skill_finalize.blocked` schema. Required: `pr_number`, `pr_url`, `from_branch`, `to_branch`, `block_reason`, `block_type` (value `"review_cap_exhausted"`); optional `leader`, `remaining_findings[]`.

Relay the agent's response verbatim to master.

| `gh pr merge` failure (conflict detected via mergeable check) | Conflict-PENDING 진입 (see PENDING gate section) |
| Conflict-PENDING `핫픽스 <hint>` resolution still fails after code-fixer | "충돌 해결 미완 — code-fixer 가 마스터 hint 로 해결 못함. 추가 핫픽스 또는 수동 해결 필요." (Conflict-PENDING 재진입) |
| `수동 머지 완료` claimed but PR state=CLOSED unmerged | "PR #<num> CLOSED (unmerged). 수동 머지 완료 trigger 와 불일치. 마스터 확인 필요." |

## Scope (v1)

In scope:
- Two-reviewer parallel code review with confidence-based filtering (≥ 80 threshold).
- Up to 3 auto-fix iterations via `code-fixer`.
- PR-based workflow (`gh` CLI), merge-commit method.
- Works on any cwd with a GitHub remote.

Out of scope (v1):
- Lint / build / test gates (`README.md` §D-23 — abolished, pending redesign).
- Squash or rebase merge methods.
- Tag creation, push to additional remotes.
- Multi-PR coordination (one PR per invocation).
- Auto-deletion of the from-branch after merge.
- Reviewer language specialization (React-specific, Express-specific, TS-specific) — Claude's full 5-agent literal model was scoped down to 2 judgment agents + context-by-main-session, with master's confirmation. Specialization can be added if a project's review patterns demand it.
